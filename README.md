# Go LED board
this project is to create a [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) 
game board made out of LEDs so that you can play go on the go

The plan is to use a an ATSAMD51 microcontroller 
to drive an array of individually address able "neopixel" WS2812 LEDs 

the first version will be a 9x9 LED matrix, with plans for a full scale one afterwards
